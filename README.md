This project is a an NBA analytics website which will be generating reports and data models based on NBA excel files turned into CSV files. There also is a page on the website for simulating your own NBA team, allowing one to feel like an NBA gm. All of the code is executed in Python (Numpy and Pandas for analytics and models) and Django for making the website. Making the teams will also be coded in pure Python.
